# Agent Interaction Diagrams for InfoFlow Social Media Simulation

This directory contains visual diagrams explaining the key interaction mechanisms in the InfoFlow Social Media Simulation.

## Diagram Overview

The diagrams in this directory provide a comprehensive visualization of how agents (social media users and accounts) interact in the simulation:

1. **Information Flow Overview** (`information_flow_overview.svg`)
   - High-level visualization of how information flows from media sources to users and between users
   - Shows the different types of social media accounts and their relationship to users
   - Illustrates content sharing pathways through the network

2. **Content Processing Flow** (`content_processing_flow.svg`)
   - Step-by-step diagram of how social media users process incoming information
   - Shows the decision points for content acceptance or rejection
   - Illustrates how cognitive parameters affect content processing

3. **Trust Update Mechanism** (`trust_update_mechanism.svg`)
   - Detailed flow of how trust in social media accounts is updated
   - Shows how content accuracy affects trust levels
   - Illustrates the role of critical thinking in trust adjustments

4. **Cognitive Parameters Effect** (`cognitive_parameters_effect.svg`)
   - Comparison of how different parameter levels affect user behavior
   - Shows the effects of confirmation bias, critical thinking, truth seeking, and social conformity
   - Explains parameter interactions and their combined effects

## Interactive Guide

An interactive HTML guide to these diagrams is also available in the `index.html` file in this directory. This guide provides detailed explanations, examples, and insights derived from the agent interaction mechanisms.

## Educational Value

These diagrams have been designed with educational goals in mind. They aim to make the complex mechanisms of social media information flow accessible and understandable by:

1. Breaking down complex processes into clear visual steps
2. Using consistent color coding and visual language across diagrams
3. Highlighting key decision points and parameter effects
4. Providing examples of how parameters combine to affect behavior

## Usage in Presentations

These diagrams can be used for:

- Educational presentations about social media information dynamics
- Explaining the mechanisms behind simulation results
- Understanding how different agent parameters affect information flow
- Demonstrating the social network effects on belief formation

Each diagram is provided in SVG format for high-quality, scalable use in presentations and documents.
