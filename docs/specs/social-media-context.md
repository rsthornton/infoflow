# InfoFlow: Social Media Context

## Overview

InfoFlow is specifically designed to model information flow in **social media networks**. This document clarifies how the components of the simulation map to real-world social media entities and dynamics.

## Model Mapping to Social Media

### User Types

1. **Regular Users** (Citizen Agents)
   - Represent everyday social media users
   - Consume and share content
   - Form social connections with other users
   - Develop trust relationships with different information sources
   - Have varying cognitive characteristics (confirmation bias, critical thinking, etc.)
   - Show different levels of social conformity and truth-seeking behavior

2. **Corporate Social Media Accounts** (Corporate Media Agents)
   - Brand accounts, news organization accounts, company pages
   - Examples: CNN, Fox News, New York Times on Twitter/Facebook
   - Generally have higher credibility but variable political bias
   - Reach a broad audience but with limited engagement
   - Post with moderate to high frequency

3. **Social Media Influencers** (Influencer Agents)
   - Individual content creators with dedicated followers
   - Examples: YouTubers, Instagram personalities, TikTok creators
   - Higher engagement rates with their audience
   - Variable credibility and truth commitment
   - Wide range of political biases
   - Post with high frequency

4. **Government Social Media Accounts** (Government Media Agents)
   - Official government agency and politician accounts
   - Examples: White House, CDC, elected officials' accounts
   - High authority but variable credibility
   - Political bias often reflects current administration
   - Reach broad audiences
   - Variable posting frequency

### Network Structure

The network structure in the model represents the connections between users on social media platforms:

- **Small World Network**: Similar to Facebook friend networks where most connections are local but with some long-distance connections
- **Scale-Free Network**: Similar to Twitter following patterns where some accounts have disproportionately many followers
- **Random Network**: More like content recommendation algorithms that may connect users without explicit relationships

### Information Flow Dynamics

The simulation captures key dynamics specific to social media:

1. **Content Creation and Posting**
   - Social media accounts create and post content with varying accuracy and political framing
   - Post frequency varies by account type

2. **Content Consumption**
   - Users see content from accounts they follow or that reaches them
   - Trust in the source affects how content is processed
   - Cognitive characteristics affect content acceptance

3. **Content Sharing**
   - Users may reshare content they've consumed
   - Sharing decisions influenced by confirmation bias and trust
   - Content may degrade slightly as it's passed along (like game of telephone)

4. **Trust Evolution**
   - Trust in different account types evolves based on perceived accuracy
   - Different user types develop different trust patterns over time

5. **Network Effects**
   - Information cascades can occur when content spreads rapidly
   - Echo chambers form in parts of the network
   - Influential nodes can disproportionately affect belief formation

## Educational Value

Understanding these social media dynamics helps explain:

- How misinformation can spread despite rational actors
- Why polarization occurs naturally in social media networks
- The effect of network structure on information flow
- How trust evolves in social media environments
- The impact of cognitive biases on social media content consumption
- The emergent ceiling on consensus (~0.72) despite ideal conditions

This social media context makes the simulation more relevant for understanding contemporary information challenges and provides a framework for exploring potential interventions in digital information ecosystems.
