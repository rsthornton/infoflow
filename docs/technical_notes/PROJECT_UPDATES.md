# InfoFlow Project Updates - April 23, 2025

## Project Status Summary

InfoFlow has completed Stage 3 Phase 1, implementing enhanced parameter controls and trust dynamics visualization. We've also added a statistics collection system to facilitate data-driven analysis. Through testing and debugging, we identified and fixed a critical issue with trust dynamics remaining static throughout simulations despite parameter changes.

## Trust Dynamics Issue Resolution

After thorough debugging, we determined that the trust update mechanism itself was functioning correctly when called, but trust values weren't changing in regular simulations because:

**ROOT CAUSE**: The media agents were not being properly tracked by the model, meaning they weren't being stepped and their content distribution methods were never called.

We implemented the following fixes:

1. **Fixed media agent tracking** to ensure media agents are properly stepped and distribute content
2. **Increased default publication rates** for all media agent types
3. **Increased influence reach parameters** to ensure more citizens receive content
4. **Added a base acceptance rate** to the content acceptance calculation to ensure more trust updates occur

These changes ensure that media agents now properly distribute content to citizens, triggering trust updates throughout the simulation. The trust dynamics issue is completely resolved. See `TRUST_DYNAMICS_FINDINGS.md` for detailed analysis.

## Latest Developments

We've made significant progress in our trust dynamics debugging efforts:

1. **Successfully Fixed Trust Dynamics**: Trust values now properly change throughout simulations in response to agent interactions.

2. **Demonstrated Functionality with Different Parameters**:
   - Extreme parameters show dramatic trust changes (from 2.0 to 0.0 for corporate trust and 8.0 to 10.0 for government trust)
   - Moderate parameters show more realistic, nuanced trust evolution with gradual changes

3. **Added Debugging Tools**:
   - Added detailed logging to trust update functions
   - Created modified test scripts to reduce API limit issues when debugging
   - Implemented parameter-controlled test cases

4. **API Limit Optimization**:
   - Redirected detailed logs to files instead of stdout
   - Added summary output options for console
   - Implemented batch operations for efficiency
