   - How do trust levels affect belief accuracy?
   - How do trust levels affect information spread?

2. **How does the amount, and the types of connectivity in social media networks influence how information spreads?**
   - How do different network topologies affect information propagation?
   - What network structures are most resilient against misinformation?
   - How does network density impact information flow?

3. **How does resistance to update one's beliefs affect information trust evaluation?**
   - How do cognitive parameters affect belief accuracy?
   - What cognitive profiles are most susceptible to misinformation?
   - How do belief resistance mechanisms interact with trust?
